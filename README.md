# Sams-PokeRadar
This program uses the PokeAPI to create a searchable database of all of the Pokemon. Through searching by the Name or ID, or filtering down Pokemon by type, ability, moves, or generation, the user can load a page containing all of the relevant information for using that Pokemon. From its stats and typing, to abilities and type interactions, users will be given all of the information they need to build a new and engaging team.
